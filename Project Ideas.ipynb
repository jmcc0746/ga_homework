    "#Overview - analyse if you can discern from prior behaviour what the statistically likelihood a player has to be bluffing\n",
    "#have a good hand, or being unpredictable. This would allow a player to gauge whether it was worth calling, raising\n",
    "#or folding, given the probability their own hand would give them of winning ie if they have an average hand but\n",
    "#their opponent could be categorized as someone who plays conservatively and raises or matches, it would\n",
    "#help the player decide not to challange this opponent. Be able to develop confidence in the prediction in a players style\n",
    "#over the course of a game, as the data set increases.\n",
    "\n",
    "#Data - data from global competitions including all the player hands, the probabilities those hands have of winning\n",
    "#and the risk/reward these players typically play by. Then cross check that against whether the model has any \n",
    "#predictive value. Data access will be the hardest part.\n",
    "\n",
    "#Analysis required - probabilities & confidence intervals.\n",

    "#IDEA 2: Farming using agriculture futures\n",
    "\n",
    "#Overview - to understand whether there is any informational value in using the relative price moves in agriultural\n",
    "#soft commodity futures to understand what crops to plant, taking into account the seasonality of actually growing\n",
    "#the crop and the time from planting to harvest. In effect do the commodity futures markets provide an intelligent \n",
    "#way to signal to determine what crops to plant.\n",
    "\n",
    "#Data - futures prices can be extracted from the CFTC website or via bloomberg. Online research will be needed to \n",

    "#Analysis required - correlations.\n",

    "#IDEA 3: optimal risk reward in randomized trading strategies\n",
    "\n",
    "#Overview - to back test random risk reward ratios (stop-loss vs take profit) for liquid financial products. E.G. \n",
    "#a random signal is constantly repeated to buy or sell a currency with a designated 0.x% stop and a 0.y% take profit\n",

    "\n",
    "#Overview - compile the average cost of a number of daily tasks that we could do ourselves (e.g. dog walking,\n",
    "#shirt washing) but choose to pay to outsource. Compare this to average incomes of the people that use that\n",
    "#use these services, potentially even by geography, and see if there are some industries that are valued\n",
    "#consistently, others that see huge variation, and whether there are factors that determine that.\n",

    "#Overview - what is the optimal FX charge from mid when you can estimate how soon you will have offseeting flow?\n",
    "#By currency, create a function that will determine how much you need to charge customers to protect yourself\n",
    "#from adverse moves in the currency market, when they lock in an agreed rate at the current time. This will give\n",
    "#give counterparts an idea of what a fair charge is e.g. if audusd on average moves 0.1% in the time in takes\n",
    "#to get offsetting flow then the flat charge should be 0.1%\n",
